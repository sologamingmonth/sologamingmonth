As you may well know, the Google+ team [recently announced the sunset of Google+](https://plus.google.com/+googleplus/posts/gxoJEZfRjPd).
This has been a real bummer for the vibrant RPG community there, and of course, the Lone Wolf Roleplaying group. In August of 
2019, G+ will shut its doors!

## Now What??

The question we've all been asking ourselves: what's next? Unfortunately, there's no easy or unanimous answer. For now, 
we're all testing the waters of various other platforms:

* [MeWe](https://mewe.com/group/5bbbfc02a40f3002b3637fdc)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Solo_Roleplaying/)
* [Discord](https://discord.gg/jwYknJY)
* [Solo Blog Directory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Solo_Roleplaying/wiki/soloblogdirectory) (Reddit)

Hang in there, and hopefully we'll all being staying connected throughout the Google+ sunset and beyond.
