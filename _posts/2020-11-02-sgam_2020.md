[**SGAM 2020**](/sgam2020) is underway and with a big thanks to [Todd Zircher](http://www.tangent-zero.com/) for organizing pretty much everything this year.

Check out the link above and, of course, have a great month of gaming and trying new things.

*Sharpen your pencils and polish your dice, SGAM kicked off on November 1st!*

Last, but not least, help get the word out about **SGAM** by sharing it on social media! [#SGAM2020](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SGAM2020)
