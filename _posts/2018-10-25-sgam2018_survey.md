title: "SGAM 2018 Project/Challenge Survey Results"
author: Spencer Salyer
---

[Last year](/sgam2017), we dedicated SGAM to the memory of the late Zach Best and his contributions to solo 
gaming through his publishing company, [Conjecture Games](). While we hope you'll remember Zack again this 
year and try out [UNE]() or [CRGE]() in your solo game, for 2018 we opened suggestions to the Lone Wolf 
Roleplaying community and [+Todd Zircher]() compiled the suggestions into a survey for voting on 
a group project and selected challenges for the month. 

## Project

The [results](https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-WX7YRTKKV/) are in, and the theme for _SGAM 2018_ 
is **Story Seeds**:
