One possible theme for **SGAM 2017** is the shared story seed and elements.
Again, feel free to join in, but don't feel obligated -- solo play is about 
doing it _your_ way!

## Zero Tarot
[+Chris Stieha](https://plus.google.com/114090179363571161590) used 
[Todd Zircher's Zero Tarot](http://www.tangent-zero.com/zero_tarot/zero_tarot.htm) 
to create a set of images that we can all draw from to drive our story.

Interpret these how you will.  Do they set up the story?  Do they describe the 
story arc?  Do you focus on the images?  The names?   The interpretations?  
It is all up to you!
