## Bestiary Examples

Here's a sampling of what we've gotten so far:

* **NPC:** lazy burglar
* **Motivations:** 
    - comprehend charity
    - damage wealth
    - inform knowledge
* **Description:**
    - They call Timothy Maulkin lazy. They say that he's just a story telling braggart at the local pub. 
What they don't know is that it is a ruse. Tim is a genius. He's the Sherlock Holmes of minor break-ins 
and petty theft. Could he steal the crown jewels? Sure, but where would you fence those?

* **NPC:** cultured expert
* **Motivations:** 
    - review legends
    - realize the world
    - compel resources
* **Description:**
    - Dr. William Huntgrave is a gentleman and a scholar of the world's mythology. His air of cultured urbanity is an asset as he works to try and gather resourcesâ€”funding, most likely, for his pet project, an exhaustive study of obscure legends and truths. He believes in his heart of hearts that this can only lead to an improved quality of life for everyone, an idealistic vision only he can see.

* **NPC:** solemn drifter
* **Motivations:** 
    - offend deprivation
    - create affluence
    - join beauty
* **Description:**
    - Archibald Dither displays the proper decorum in most any company or situation. His emotions seldom drift from an even keel.
Except when it comes to bunches of money and the company of beautiful people and things. He gets quite upset if anyone hinders his attainment of such.
Dirty pool kind of upset, but not overtly, if it can be avoided.
He's a sort of jack-of-all-trades, competent, but master of none.
Keep him from being upset and he is a steady companion and true.

* **NPC:** nefarious aristocrat
* **Motivations:** 
    - promote strength
    - realize academia
    - record ghosts
* **Description:**
    - Weary of the incessant demands of diplomacy, dissatisfied with their meager returns in sovereignty, Atticus seeks *more*. Dominion. Control. Power! The pendant around his neck is no simple adornment, but an amulet of unholy origin. For each soul it consumes, Atticus grows in both knowledge and strength -- but for how long, and at what cost?

---
    
* **NPC:** Superfluous Gypsy
* **Motivations:** 
    - Take Dreams
    - Advise Wealth
    - Shepherd the Wealthy
* **Description:**
    - She basically tricks rich people into giving her their money to the point of bankruptcy. Whether she gives it to the poor or herself is up to you.

---

* **NPC:** titled servant
* **Motivations:** 
    - report pleasure
    - conceive vigilance
    - hinder intelligence
* **Description:**
    - Belonging to a lesser household, the patrician life suited Randall quite well. His duties are few, his hardships fewer still, and as the youngest of his brethren, there is little chance of romance or the responsibility of carrying on the family name -- all the better, considering his frail physique and pallid complexion. Despite all this, Randall knows his purpose in life -- to dance the dance of political intrigue. Smiling, laughing, and nodding amongst the gentry, all the while collecting information, testing, probing, and connecting dots. Uncovering secrets for later strategic deployment, or to keep as his own -- whichever serves him best -- for one day, *he* will be the supreme puppet-master of the realm, pulling the strings to achieve his own desires.
