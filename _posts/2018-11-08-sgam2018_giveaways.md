---

New for 2018, we've partnered with [**Larcenous Designs**](https://www.larcenousdesigns.com/) to offer some giveaways to **SGAM** participants!

Nathan Rockwood, educator, game designer, and proprietor of **Larcenous Designs, LLC** has graciously agreed to offer up 
several of the ever-popular _The GameMaster's Apprentice_ decks as giveaways to SGAM participants. We're very 
excited to have this support and the opportunity to hand out some freebies!

_Larcenous Designs is dedicated to the theory that games are as important to the world as any other form of 
literature, and all our work is meant to promote games as a worthwhile experience for everyone. Please join 
us in bringing gaming not just into the mainstream of recreation, but into learning and academia as well!_

### The Giveaways

[_The GameMaster's Apprentice_ decks](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?keywords=The+GameMaster%27s+Apprentice&manufacturers_id=6395)
are a prized possession of many a solo and GM-less gamer, GMs, and even authors! Each of 7 themed decks has 120 cards and each card 
includes a dozen or more randomizers for generating everything from dice rolls to sights and sounds to NPCs 
and random events. If you aren't familiar, I recommend you check out the (free) 
[instruction download through DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/219478/The-GameMasters-Apprentice-Universal-Instruction-Cards?manufacturers_id=6395)
and the demonstration videos on Youtube.

The plan is to give away **one of each** of the 7 GMA decks to **Story Seed** participants. But that's not all! 
**A Grand Prize that includes all 7 decks** will be awarded to the winner of [**a NEW challenge**](/sgam2018/#new-challenge).

Each winner will receive a DriveThruRPG download link/code good for a FREE PDF version of the deck(s) (regularly $9.99/each) and 
_at-cost_ print-on-demand pricing (about $5-6 per deck, plus shipping -- roughly 70% off the full retail price).

into a raffle to be drawn at the end of the month for one of 7 themed GMA decks. Easy as that! 

To be entered for the **Grand Prize**, you must complete [the new challenge](/sgam2018/#new-challenge) to **Create a solo game or tool for the community**. 
At the close of SGAM 2018, one of our solo gaming cat herders (Todd Zircher) will create a poll with links
to all entries. Then, the solo gaming community will **vote for a winner**.
