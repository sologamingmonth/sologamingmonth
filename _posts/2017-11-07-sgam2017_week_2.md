title: "Week 2: Adventure Grab Bags"

[+Spencer Salyer](https://plus.google.com/+SDSalyer) from 
[Wisps of Time](http://wispsoftime.com) has 
generated several adventure "grab bags" to get your game started! As 
this year's **SGAM** is dedicated to Zach Best, the focus here is on 
Conjecture Games' [_Universal NPC Emulator_](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/134163/UNE-The-Universal-NPC-Emulator-rev?manufacturers_id=7251).

Using **UNE**, [_Sharp Swords & Sinister Spells_](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/198163/Sharp-Swords--Sinister-Spells?manufacturers_id=10771)
 and its [_Addendum_](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/219747/Sharp-Swords--Sinister-Spells--Addendum?manufacturers_id=10771)'s 
adventure generators, and a random word list generator 
found at [Fifteen Minutes of Fiction](http://www.fifteenminutesoffiction.com/grabbag.asp?count=5),
Spencer has come up with several sets of details to spur the imagination, 
get those gears turning, and take you off in unexpected directions. Oh, and.. a challenge!

## The Setup

If you're new to solo play, or just curious, here's the process used (if you just want the goods, 
[click here](#goods)):

As it so happens, the _SS&SS_ books are "pay what you want", so you can grab them for free (they're totally 
worth the recommended price, however) and generate your own adventures. Or, if you're an Android user[^1], there's 
a handy dandy app called [_AdventureSmith_](https://stevesea.github.io/Adventuresmith/) that is chock full of various generators and dice rollers that 
are super useful for the solitaire player.

[^1]:There are other ways, including browser plugins and command line tools, to use _AdventureSmith_.

I took the shortcut and used the app, since it contains all the 
generators from _SS&SS_ as well as the "adventure title" generator from the _Addendum_ (which has quite a few 
generators -- including a monster generator! -- that are not yet in the app, so check out the book/pdf!).

I started with "adventure title". I generated about 10 or 12, some of them silly or nonsensical, but others 
thought-provoking -- like _The Profane Flower_, for example. I picked 4 that I liked, then generated several 
adventures until I felt like things "lined up" with my titles. Now, you can take the inverse approach, or just 
take what you're given, but I was aiming to construct something compelling (and somewhat genre-inspecific) for 
sharing with you good folks.

I similarly generated the word lists until I could see them "matching" with my title and story seed. Put it all 
together and BAM! a sort-of-themed-in-my-eyes adventure grab bag.

For the final of the generated seeds, I set aside _SS&SS_ and _AdventureSmith_, pulled out my d100s and **UNE**.
I'd heard a lot of good things about it, but I'd never used it myself, so I was interested to see where it led.
The book suggests creating adventure hooks by simply generating a few characters and then weaving the webs 
between them. That's what I've done here (below), and I am pretty impressed with the outcome! I can definitely 
see a _Game of Thrones_-style power struggle in a setting of tense, but proper, diplomacy.

I hope you found this section useful, and I look forward to hearing about the play sessions that come out of these, 
or better yet -- the ones you were inspired to generate yourself!

## The Challenge

What? A challenge?! Well, sort of... It's more of a "see if you can do it, but hey... sorry there's no real reward 
except your own self-satisfaction and bragging rights amidst your actual play peers" kind of thing. Anyhow...

**I hereby challenge thee to:**

* Include all the words from the word list in your story / actual play write-up
* Use **UNE** to "motivate" the Antagonist and Supporting Character (or any/all NPCs), then to emulate their interactions.
* Forget about all this and use **UNE**, _SS&SS_, and/or _AdventureSmith_ to create your own story seed (don't forget the word list!)
* **Have Fun!**

## The Grab Bags	{#goods}

Below are three grab bags generated using _Sharp Swords & Sinister Spells_. 
The fourth grab bag was generated using _only_ **UNE**! Feel free to mix and 
match, or roll your own. And, of course, come back and tell us about it!

## What Do I Do With All This?

Use the grab bags to start your adventure or the next scene of your current campaign. Given those elements, how can you weave them 
together into a cohesive story hook? 

* Is that supporting NPC a good guy, a roadblock, or perhaps working for the enemy?
* Perhaps "immortal ghost" is your Obi-Wan Kenobi.
* Are "Vampiric primitive humanoids" rabid blood-thirsty monkeys or something from the Walking Dead? 
* Does that "location of legendary treasure" lead you into your next adventure or is it a pot of gold under the rainbow?
* Stuck on what to do next? Maybe the word list has something for you!

I've tried to make semi-logical links between title, adventure/characters, and word lists, but maybe that's only in my own mind. 
Take what works for you and throw out what doesn't, or just use these for inspiration -- perhaps just reading over them all 
gives you all the ideas you need without strictly following these elements. Whatever you do, I hope those wheels are turning 
and have you itching to roll some dice!
