_Already ready already? [submit your **UNE** NPC below](#bestform)_

As you all know, **SGAM 2017** stands in memoriam of Zach Best, founder of 
[Conjecture Games](http://conjecturegames.com/) and 
author of several significant works in the solo-roleplaying community. As discussions about a theme 
for Week 3 came up on the Lone Wolf Role-playing G+ group, 
[+Todd Zircher](https://plus.google.com/+ToddZircher) shared his idea of a 
collaborative effort to create, collect, and share _UNE_-generated characters. 

# What is UNE?

The [Universal NPC Emulator](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/134163/UNE-The-Universal-NPC-Emulator-rev) 
is one of Zach's most influential creations, which allows for both creating 
_and_ emulating NPCs for your games. It's a great resource and has endless possibilities for 
combinations of character traits and motivations, in addition to conversational mood and focus. 

The tool is so versatile, it can be used to supplement your exisiting solo game, group campaign, writing 
effort, or even stand alone as its own adventure seed generator and soloing engine. If you've 
not given it a try, there's no better time than now -- and you won't regret it! 

## The Zach Bestiary

Todd's clever moniker for this collection of _UNE_ characters is **The Zach Bestiary**. His goal is to create 
a living resource for role-players to shortcut NPC creation for use in their games:


 > ... it's intended to be a resource for anyone either for NPCs as is or to inspire others.  Have fun, create a 
few and we'll share them all at the end of #SGAM2017... [^1]

He's created a Google Form to collect your UNE-generated NPCs, so do give it a try and submit your 
responses to [the form below](#bestform).

### Example

Todd also provided an example:

* **NPC:** lazy burglar
* **Motivations:** 
    - comprehend charity
    - damage wealth
    - inform knowledge
* **Description:**
    - They call Timothy Maulkin lazy. They say that he's just a story telling braggart at the local pub. 
What they don't know is that it is a ruse. Tim is a genius. He's the Sherlock Holmes of minor break-ins 
and petty theft. Could he steal the crown jewels? Sure, but where would you fence those?

## Submit your UNE-generated NPC to the Zach Bestiary {#bestform}
