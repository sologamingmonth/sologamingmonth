Solo Gaming Appreciation Month starts November 1st, 2019! Survey results are in and the **SGAM** projects 
and themes for this year are set! You can check out last year's 
mischief [here](/sgam2018), and information for 2019 is below.

[In 2017](/sgam2017), we dedicated SGAM to the memory of the late Zach Best and his contributions to solo 
gaming through his publishing company, [Conjecture Games](). While we hope you'll remember Zack again this 
year and try out [UNE]() or [CRGE]() in your solo game, for 2019 we opened suggestions to the Lone Wolf 
Roleplaying community and [Todd Zircher](http://www.tangent-zero.com/) compiled the suggestions into a survey for voting on 
a group project and selected challenges for the month.

## Do we have any themes or challenges? 

As always, solitaire gaming is about enjoying tabletop gaming in your own way, but of course, we're here 
to get you started and playing along with some **SGAM Challenges**! 

### Week 1

#### [Solo Game Chef 2019](https://itch.io/jam/solo-game-chef)

*Hosted by Solo RPG Voyager* Â· [#SoloGameChef2019](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SoloGameChef2019)

> Hello, and welcome to the first Solo Game Chef jam. The rules for this are simple. You are to write a short soloable tabletop game based off only six pictures that you'll roll from Tangent Zero's Zero Dice page. You may use these images in anyway you wish, such as the fluff of the game or how it factors into the crunch, so long as you use all six images.
>
> There's no other stipulations as this is the first Solo Game Chef, so go nuts, go crazy, and have fun for this Solo Gaming Appreciation Month!

The jam has already started!

### Week 2

Play/Create something that's not fantasy or classic RPG tropes.
Since we had a tie for fourth, I'm rolling *"Play a mystery game where even you don't know who did it"* into this challenge.

### Week 3

Community idea, a book of oracles that use a deck of cards as the randomizer.
I think a one page table would be the the best way to present this.
I have done something like that with poker and tarot decks. Write up up a few sentences for an introduction and populate the table with the contents of your deck, I'll work up some templates this weekend.

### Week 4

Write something to introduce people to solo gaming.
I saved this for last because there might be something SGAM related that you might want to include. If this does not strike your fancy, call it a wild card challenge.

Have a great month of gaming and trying new things.

## Rule One

Have fun. We do this for the love of the game. If you want to do the challenges out of order or you're not inspired by a topic, that's cool. You don't even have to share if that's not your thing. Of course, any format on any platform is acceptable. Heck, if you're playing Sea Dracula and you want to film yourself doing a silly dance, I'd LOVE to see that. 


# Lastly...

Last, but not least, help get the word out about **SGAM** by sharing it on social media! [#SGAM2019](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SGAM2019)
