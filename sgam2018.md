## Story Seeds

[Last year](/sgam2017), we dedicated SGAM to the memory of the late Zach Best and his contributions to solo 
gaming through his publishing company, [Conjecture Games](). While we hope you'll remember Zack again this 
year and try out [UNE]() or [CRGE]() in your solo game, for 2018 we opened suggestions to the Lone Wolf 
Roleplaying community and [+Todd Zircher]() compiled the suggestions into a survey for voting on 
a group project and selected challenges for the month. 

| Project Choices                                                                                              | RESPONSES |    |

The [results](https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-WX7YRTKKV/) are in, and the theme for _SGAM 2018_ 
is **Story Seeds**:

> **Story Seeds**
>
> Roll three game icons (using a free web site) and describe a starting scene.

The results for your story seed submissions will be collected throughout the month of November and compiled 
into a single resource for use for kicking off your solitaire role-playing sessions.

### How can you participate in **SGAM**?  

There's lots of ways!

* _PLAY_ and **post**!  
* Create tools and **post**!  
* Make NPCs and **post**!  
* Even if you don't **post**, *PLAY*!

_P.S. Don't forget your #SGAM and #SGAM2018 hashtags._

### Do we have any themes or challenges? 

As always, solitaire gaming is about enjoying tabletop gaming in your own way, but of course, we're here 
to get you started and playing along with some **SGAM Challenges**! 

As mentioned, above, [+Todd Zircher]() compiled the Lone Wolf Roleplaying community suggestions for a group 
project and weekly challenges into [a survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-WX7YRTKKV/) and the
