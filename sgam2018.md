## Story Seeds

[Last year](/sgam2017), we dedicated SGAM to the memory of the late Zach Best and his contributions to solo 
gaming through his publishing company, [Conjecture Games](http://conjecturegames.com/). While we hope you'll remember Zack again this 
year and try out [UNE](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/134163/UNE-The-Universal-NPC-Emulator-rev) or [CRGE](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/145426/CRGE-Conjectural-Roleplaying-GM-Emulator) in your solo game, for 2018 we opened suggestions to the Lone Wolf 
Roleplaying community and [+Todd Zircher](https://plus.google.com/+ToddZircher) compiled the suggestions into a survey for voting on 
a group project and selected challenges for the month. 

The [results](https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-WX7YRTKKV/) are in, and the theme for _SGAM 2018_ 
is **Story Seeds**:

> **Story Seeds**
>
> Roll three game icons (using a free web site) and describe a starting scene.

The results for your story seed submissions will be collected throughout the month of November and compiled 
into a single resource for use for kicking off your solitaire role-playing sessions.

### How can you participate in **SGAM**?  

There's lots of ways!

* _PLAY_ and **post**!  
* Create tools and **post**!  
* Make NPCs and **post**!  
* Even if you don't **post**, *PLAY*!

_P.S. Don't forget your #SGAM and #SGAM2018 hashtags._

### Do we have any themes or challenges? 

As always, solitaire gaming is about enjoying tabletop gaming in your own way, but of course, we're here 
to get you started and playing along with some **SGAM Challenges**! 

#### Week One Challenge: 

New and Shiny, expand your frontiers and play a new game or new genre. Perhaps play something in a new way such as taking an old game and playing it with a completely different solo system.

#### Week Two Challenge: 

Hybrid Game, combine solo role playing with another game (such as a board game, a micro game, or a card game.) The idea being that the non-RPG game acts as a driver for the solo gaming experience. The level of mixing is up to the individual. It can be something as surreal as your journey through Candy Land, role playing in the mean streets of Monopoly, mourning your loved ones on the Oregon Trail, or a gritty war journal about what happens to soldiers caught in between the turns of a war game.

#### Week Three Project: 

Story Seeds, take three random icons and write of a paragraph or three about the story or scene that they inspire. I'll set up a Google Forms page and some instructions. The goal is to create a free PDF to share with the group so that they have a collection of creative ideas to use.

#### Week Four Challenge: 

Open, a chance to finish up the challenges, add more Story Seeds, or perhaps create some fun tools. I'll be working on a solo project for NaGaDeMon as an example.

#### Rule One:

 Have fun. We do this for the love of the game. If you want to do the challenges out of order or you're not inspired by a topic, that's cool. You don't even have to share if that's not your thing. Of course, any format on any platform is acceptable. Heck, if you're playing Sea Dracula and you want to film yourself doing a silly dance, I'd LOVE to see that.
