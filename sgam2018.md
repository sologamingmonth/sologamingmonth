## SGAM2018 Giveaways!

New for 2018, we've partnered with [**Larcenous Designs**](https://www.larcenousdesigns.com/) to offer some giveaways to **SGAM** participants!

Nathan Rockwood, educator, game designer, and proprietor of **Larcenous Designs, LLC** has graciously agreed to offer up 
several of the ever-popular _The GameMaster's Apprentice_ decks as giveaways to SGAM participants. We're very 
excited to have this support and the opportunity to hand out some freebies!

[![Larcenous Designs](/images/sgam2018/LarcenousDesignsLogo-WaxSeal small.png){: .float-left}](https://www.larcenousdesigns.com/)
_Larcenous Designs is dedicated to the theory that games are as important to the world as any other form of 
literature, and all our work is meant to promote games as a worthwhile experience for everyone. Please join 
us in bringing gaming not just into the mainstream of recreation, but into learning and academia as well!_

### The Giveaways

[_The GameMaster's Apprentice_ decks](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?keywords=The+GameMaster%27s+Apprentice&manufacturers_id=6395)
are a prized possession of many a solo and GM-less gamer, GMs, and even authors! Each of 7 themed decks has 120 cards and each card 
includes a dozen or more randomizers for generating everything from dice rolls to sights and sounds to NPCs 
and random events. If you aren't familiar, I recommend you check out the (free) 
[instruction download through DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/219478/The-GameMasters-Apprentice-Universal-Instruction-Cards?manufacturers_id=6395)
and the demonstration videos on Youtube.

The plan is to give away **one of each** of the 7 GMA decks to **Story Seed** participants. But that's not all! 
**A Grand Prize that includes all 7 decks** will be awarded to the winner of [**a NEW challenge**](#new-challenge).

Each winner will receive a DriveThruRPG download link/code good for a FREE PDF version of the deck(s) (regularly $9.99/each) and 
_at-cost_ print-on-demand pricing (about $5-6 per deck, plus shipping -- roughly 70% off the full retail price).

into a raffle to be drawn at the end of the month for one of 7 themed GMA decks. Easy as that! 

To be entered for the **Grand Prize**, you must complete [the new challenge]((#new-challenge)) to **Create a solo game or tool for the community**. 
At the close of SGAM 2018, one of our solo gaming cat herders (Todd Zircher) will create a poll with links
to all entries. Then, the solo gaming community will **vote for a winner**.

## NEW Challenge

**Create a solo game or tool for the community.** This can be a full game or RPG, an oracle,
random generator tables, inspirational cards, or even an app or web site. At the
end of the month, one of our solo gaming cat herders will create a poll with links
to all entries. Then, the solo gaming community will vote for their favorite.

## Story Seeds

[Last year](/sgam2017), we dedicated SGAM to the memory of the late Zach Best and his contributions to solo 
gaming through his publishing company, [Conjecture Games](http://conjecturegames.com/). While we hope you'll remember Zack again this 
year and try out [UNE](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/134163/UNE-The-Universal-NPC-Emulator-rev) or [CRGE](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/145426/CRGE-Conjectural-Roleplaying-GM-Emulator) in your solo game, for 2018 we opened suggestions to the Lone Wolf 
Roleplaying community and [+Todd Zircher](https://plus.google.com/+ToddZircher) compiled the suggestions into a survey for voting on 
a group project and selected challenges for the month. 

The [results](https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-WX7YRTKKV/) are in, and the theme for _SGAM 2018_ 
is **Story Seeds**:

> **Story Seeds**
>
> Roll three game icons (using a free web site) and describe a starting scene.

The results for your story seed submissions will be collected throughout the month of November and compiled 
into a single resource for use for kicking off your solitaire role-playing sessions.

### How can you participate in **SGAM**?  

There's lots of ways!

* _PLAY_ and **post**!  
* Create tools and **post**!  
* Make NPCs and **post**!  
* Even if you don't **post**, *PLAY*!

_P.S. Don't forget your #SGAM and #SGAM2018 hashtags._

## Do we have any themes or challenges? 

As always, solitaire gaming is about enjoying tabletop gaming in your own way, but of course, we're here 
to get you started and playing along with some **SGAM Challenges**! 

### Week One Challenge

**New and Shiny**, expand your frontiers and play a new game or new genre. Perhaps play something in a new way such as taking an old game and playing it with a completely different solo system.

### Week Two Challenge

**Hybrid Game**, combine solo role playing with another game (such as a board game, a micro game, or a card game.) The idea being that the non-RPG game acts as a driver for the solo gaming experience. The level of mixing is up to the individual. It can be something as surreal as your journey through Candy Land, role playing in the mean streets of Monopoly, mourning your loved ones on the Oregon Trail, or a gritty war journal about what happens to soldiers caught in between the turns of a war game.

### Week Three Project

**Story Seeds**, take three random icons and write of a paragraph or three about the story or scene that they inspire. I'll set up a Google Forms page and some instructions. The goal is to create a free PDF to share with the group so that they have a collection of creative ideas to use.

### Week Four Challenge 

**Open**, a chance to finish up the challenges, add more Story Seeds, or perhaps create some fun tools. I'll be working on a solo project for NaGaDeMon as an example.

### Rule One

Have fun. We do this for the love of the game. If you want to do the challenges out of order or you're not inspired by a topic, that's cool. You don't even have to share if that's not your thing. Of course, any format on any platform is acceptable. Heck, if you're playing Sea Dracula and you want to film yourself doing a silly dance, I'd LOVE to see that.
