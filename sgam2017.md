## Dedicated to Zach Best

As you know, we recently lost **Zach Best**, founder of 
[Conjecture Games](http://conjecturegames.com/), 
creator of many great products geared towards solo play, and, of course, 
**a great person**. Therefore, _we have decided to dedicate this **SGAM 2017** to him._

If you'd like to help out Zach's family, consider purchasing 
[Zach's Book](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/218834/Zachs-Book) 
or one of his
[Conjecture Games](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/7251/Conjecture-Games) 
products on [DriveThruRPG](http://www.drivethrurpg.com).

## The Why and How of Solo-Gaming

Along with the dedication, we will put together a collection of solo gaming 
tools and examples to create a pdf to help people understand the why and how of 
solo gaming.  Everything is welcome, from tools to actual plays.  Tell 
[+Chris Stieha](https://plus.google.com/114090179363571161590) if you want your 
stuff included in the compilation.

### How can you participate in **SGAM**?  

There's lots of ways!

* _PLAY_ and **post**!  
* Create tools and **post**!  
* Make NPCs and **post**!  
* Even if you don't **post**, *PLAY*!

_P.S. Don't forget your #SGAM and #SGAM2017 hashtags._

### What can you use? 

**Everything!**  Check out Zach's work, but use anything that you want. 
Everything is welcome in the compilation.

### Do we have any themes? 

Feel free to do what you want, but we have some suggestions:

1. People use some common elements to inspire their story
2. People start with the same story seed
3. Develop NPCs using [UNE](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/134163/UNE-The-Universal-NPC-Emulator-rev) 
and post them for people to use

# Week 1: Shared Story Structure

One possible theme for **SGAM 2017** is the shared story seed and elements.
Again, feel free to join in, but don't feel obligated -- solo play is about 
doing it _your_ way!

## Zero Tarot
[+Chris Stieha](https://plus.google.com/114090179363571161590) used 
[Todd Zircher's Zero Tarot](http://www.tangent-zero.com/zero_tarot/zero_tarot.htm) 
to create a set of images that we can all draw from to drive our story. 

[![Zero Tarot]({{ "/images/sgam2017/SGAM2017-elements.jpg" | absolute_url }})]({{ "/images/sgam2017/SGAM2017-elements.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Interpret these how you will.  Do they set up the story?  Do they describe the 
story arc?  Do you focus on the images?  The names?   The interpretations?  
It is all up to you!

# Week 2: Adventure Grab Bags

[+Spencer Salyer](https://plus.google.com/+SDSalyer) from 
[Wisps of Time](http://wispsoftime.com) has 
generated several adventure "grab bags" to get your game started! As 
this year's **SGAM** is dedicated to Zach Best, the focus here is on 
Conjecture Games' [_Universal NPC Emulator_](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/134163/UNE-The-Universal-NPC-Emulator-rev?manufacturers_id=7251).

Using **UNE**, [_Sharp Swords & Sinister Spells_](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/198163/Sharp-Swords--Sinister-Spells?manufacturers_id=10771)
 and its [_Addendum_](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/219747/Sharp-Swords--Sinister-Spells--Addendum?manufacturers_id=10771)'s 
adventure generators, and a random word list generator 
found at [Fifteen Minutes of Fiction](http://www.fifteenminutesoffiction.com/grabbag.asp?count=5),
Spencer has come up with several sets of details to spur the imagination, 
get those gears turning, and take you off in unexpected directions. Oh, and.. a challenge!

## The Challenge

What? A challenge?! Well, sort of... It's more of a "see if you can do it, but hey... sorry there's no real reward 
except your own self-satisfaction and bragging rights amidst your actual play peers" kind of thing. Anyhow...

**I hereby challenge thee to:**

* Include all the words from the word list in your story / actual play write-up
* Use **UNE** to "motivate" the Antagonist and Supporting Character (or any/all NPCs), then to emulate their interactions.
* Forget about all this and use **UNE**, _SS&SS_, and/or _AdventureSmith_ to create your own story seed (don't forget the word list!)
* **Have Fun!**

## The Grab Bags	{#goods}

Below are three grab bags generated using _Sharp Swords & Sinister Spells_. 
The fourth grab bag was generated using _only_ **UNE**! Feel free to mix and 
match, or roll your own. And, of course, come back and tell us about it!

## What Do I Do With All This?

Use the grab bags to start your adventure or the next scene of your current campaign. Given those elements, how can you weave them 
together into a cohesive story hook? Play it out, write it up, and #SGAM it!

_For more information on how this was set up and how to use it, check out [this post](/2017/sgam2017_week_2/)._

# Week 3: Zach Bestiary

As you all know, **SGAM 2017** stands in memoriam of Zach Best, founder of 
[Conjecture Games](http://conjecturegames.com/) and 
author of several significant works in the solo-roleplaying community. As discussions about a theme 
for Week 3 came up on the Lone Wolf Role-playing G+ group, 
[+Todd Zircher](https://plus.google.com/+ToddZircher) shared his idea of a 
collaborative effort to create, collect, and share _UNE_-generated characters. 

## The Zach Bestiary

Todd's clever moniker for this collection of _UNE_ characters is **The Zach Bestiary**. His goal is to create 
a living resource for role-players to shortcut NPC creation for use in their games:


 > ... it's intended to be a resource for anyone either for NPCs as is or to inspire others.  Have fun, create a 
few and we'll share them all at the end of #SGAM2017...

He's created a Google Form to collect your UNE-generated NPCs, so do give it a try and submit your 
responses to [the form below](#bestform).

### Example

Todd also provided an example:

* **NPC:** lazy burglar
* **Motivations:** 
    - comprehend charity
    - damage wealth
    - inform knowledge
* **Description:**
    - They call Timothy Maulkin lazy. They say that he's just a story telling braggart at the local pub. 
What they don't know is that it is a ruse. Tim is a genius. He's the Sherlock Holmes of minor break-ins 
and petty theft. Could he steal the crown jewels? Sure, but where would you fence those?

## Submit your UNE-generated NPC to the Zach Bestiary {#bestform}

To submit your _UNE_ NPC, simply fill out the Google Form linked below, and provide the details 
following Todd's example, above.

<div style="text-align: center; padding: 2em;">
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdmJBA0YfBbOQhGsAHGGO5R3W4_m5ibcECIryCOrgChr7hC8w/viewform"
      style="cursor: pointer;"
      class="btn btn-large">
      <i class="icon icon-torsos-all"></i> Submit <i>UNE</i> NPC 
    </a>
</div>

You can read more about it [here](/sgam2017_week_3_zach_bestiary/) and we look forward to seeing all 
the submissions and sharing them with you at the end of **SGAM 2017**!

# Week 3: Games Designed for One Player

The focus of **SGAM** tends to be around playing traditional 
role-playing games (intended for a group of players) as a 
single participant -- usually with some sort of artificial means 
for compensating against the lack of players and/or GM. 

It should be noted, however, that there are other games out 
there -- many overlapping 
or closely resembling the RPG category, others stemming from 
roots in solitaire wargaming, board games, or card games -- 
that are designed, not for 
a group of players, but for a **single, solitary player**. Or, in some 
cases,  
scale easily: down to one player, or up _from_ one player (in 
the off chance a group of players is willing and able to join 
you). 

That's what 
this post is about: sharing some of those single-player games 
for your consideration, and in light of our quest here for 
**SGAM**, your _appreciation_. 

By no means comprehensive, but most of these were 
collected  from suggestions by members of the Lone Wolf Role-playing G+ 
Community.
