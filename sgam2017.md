Solo Gaming Appreciation Month <s>starts in a few days</s> (November 1st!) 
**is here**, so get your Oracles and Rules ready!  Or be prepared to make new ones!

## Dedicated to Zach Best

As you know, we recently lost **Zach Best**, founder of 
[Conjecture Games](http://conjecturegames.com/), 
creator of many great products geared towards solo play, and, of course, 
**a great person**. Therefore, _we have decided to dedicate this **SGAM 2017** to him._

If you'd like to help out Zach's family, consider purchasing 
[Zach's Book](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/218834/Zachs-Book) 
or one of his
[Conjecture Games](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/7251/Conjecture-Games) 
products on [DriveThruRPG](http://www.drivethrurpg.com).

## The Why and How of Solo-Gaming

Along with the dedication, we will put together a collection of solo gaming 
tools and examples to create a pdf to help people understand the why and how of 
solo gaming.  Everything is welcome, from tools to actual plays.  Tell 
[+Chris Stieha](https://plus.google.com/114090179363571161590) if you want your 
stuff included in the compilation.

### How can you participate in **SGAM**?  

There's lots of ways!

* _PLAY_ and **post**!  
* Create tools and **post**!  
* Make NPCs and **post**!  
* Even if you don't **post**, *PLAY*!

_P.S. Don't forget your #SGAM and #SGAM2017 hashtags._

### What can you use? 

**Everything!**  Check out Zach's work, but use anything that you want. 
Everything is welcome in the compilation.

### Do we have any themes? 

Feel free to do what you want, but we have some suggestions:

1. People use some common elements to inspire their story
2. People start with the same story seed
3. Develop NPCs using [UNE](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/134163/UNE-The-Universal-NPC-Emulator-rev) 
and post them for people to use

# Week 1: Shared Story Structure

One possible theme for **SGAM 2017** is the shared story seed and elements.
Again, feel free to join in, but don't feel obligated -- solo play is about 
doing it _your_ way!

## Zero Tarot
[+Chris Stieha](https://plus.google.com/114090179363571161590) used 
[Todd Zircher's Zero Tarot](http://www.tangent-zero.com/zero_tarot/zero_tarot.htm) 
to create a set of images that we can all draw from to drive our story. 

[![Zero Tarot]({{ "/images/sgam2017/SGAM2017-elements.jpg" | absolute_url }})]({{ "/images/sgam2017/SGAM2017-elements.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Interpret these how you will.  Do they set up the story?  Do they describe the 
story arc?  Do you focus on the images?  The names?   The interpretations?  
It is all up to you!
