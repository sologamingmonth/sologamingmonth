title: Solo Gaming Appreciation Month

**Solo Gaming Appreciation Month (SGAM)** is a community effort to revive the 
efforts of [+John Fiore](https://plus.google.com/+JohnFiore) to get people to 
show solo gaming a little love. **SGAM** was started by John on his (now 
private) _Solo Nexus_ blog in November of 2011 -- because of the **11/11** 
date -- and he thought it would end there. The idea, however, was resurrected 
in 2015 by [+Steven Lincoln](https://plus.google.com/+StevenLincolnTCS/posts/ZvZ9UinnESK) 
at the [**Lone Wolf Role-Playing G+**](https://plus.google.com/communities/116965157741523529510) 
community and has continued annually since.

While John never anticipated that it would go past that first month, amazing 
people like +Alex Yari, +Chris Stieha, and everyone else at the  
**Lone Wolf Role-Playing G+** community keep the torch burning!

## Google+ Sunset

As you may well know, the Google+ team [recently announced the sunset of Google+](https://plus.google.com/+googleplus/posts/gxoJEZfRjPd).
This has been a real bummer for the vibrant RPG community there, and of course, the Lone Wolf Roleplaying group. In August of 
2019, G+ will shut its doors!

### New Home?

The question we've all been asking ourselves: what's next? Unfortunately, there's no easy or unanimous answer. For now, 
we're all testing the waters of various other platforms:

* Join our new MeWe group at: [https://mewe.com/group/5bbbfc02a40f3002b3637fdc](https://mewe.com/group/5bbbfc02a40f3002b3637fdc)

* We're also collecting a solo gaming blog listing at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Solo_Roleplaying/wiki/soloblogdirectory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Solo_Roleplaying/wiki/soloblogdirectory)


## But, What is **SGAM**?

It _mostly_ consists of players engaging in solitaire role-playing games, board 
games, card games, wargames, or other "tabletop" games then writing about and 
sharing their play sessions online -- called "actual play reports" (or just 
"actual play" or "AP"). 

Some folks also dedicate the month to inventing cool new tools and additions to 
their solo gaming experiments and sharing those with the community.

## Solo Gaming?

If you're new to solo gaming, you may be wondering what it is! 

The often-recommended response to that question is to check out the [getting 
started](https://dieheart.net/getting-started-solo/) and 
[solo RPG resources](https://dieheart.net/solo-rpg-resources/) pages on 
[+Sophia Brandt]()'s _Die Heart_ blog.

Here is the community's attempt at a definition:

1. Solo Gaming: A hobby of many hats! Be the Game Master, Play the Hero, Create 
a World!
2. Solo gaming is a hobby embodying aspects of tabletop gaming, world building 
and a wide range of creative pursuits. All at your own pace and geared toward 
your interests.
3. Solo Gaming: The only time "playing with yourself" won't be labeled NSFW!

## OK, So... What do I do?

If you play games (primarily tabletop role-playing games) solo, or ever wanted 
to or wished you could, you can contribute to **SGAM** by 

1. **Give it a try!** Engage in play or create something for solo gamers. 
Examples:
  * Actual Play Reports
  * Chart of random things
  * A game designed for 1 player
  * [more ideas](http://link_to_ideas)
2. **Share it** on social media with the **#SGAM** and/or **#SGAM{{ site.time | date: '%Y' }}** hashtags. 
3. **Check us out** on Google+ at the [Lone Wolf Role-Playing]() community. There's 
a [category](https://plus.google.com/communities/116965157741523529510/stream/585437a3-a1dc-49d2-a1f2-a1560d540ee3)
there with more information.
